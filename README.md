## Getting started
## Prerequisites
You don't need to be a tech wizard, but a few basics will help:
-**Python**: Install Python 3.8+ ([Download here](https://ww.python.org/downloads/)). Don't worrry, we'll guide you!
-**Neurodesk**: A free platform for neuroimaging tools. [Get it here](https://www.neurodesk.org/) or use Neurodesk play[Get it here](https://play.neurodesk.org/)-we'll show you how to set it up.
-**Git**:To clone this repo ([Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)).

No radiology or coding experience? No problem-this is for *absolute beginners*.
 ### How to use
 1. **Clone this repo**: Run https://github.com/vvayebare/image-analysis-for-dummies/tree/main in your terminal.
 2. Open a Jupyter notebook (we'll explain how!)
 3. Follow along with our simple tutorials-each one is designed to take you 'huh?' to 'I got this!' in minutes.
## My story
During my *neuroimaging fellowship*, I hit a wall: no background in image analysis, endless error messages, and hours lost Googling fixes. It slowed our team down, left me frustrated, and made me realize I wasnâ€™t alone. Many beginners, especially in Africa where resources are scarce, face these same hurdles. Thatâ€™s why I created this repoâ€”to make image analysis (especially for MRI) so simple that anyone can do it. From basic commands to dodging errors, this is the guide I desperately needed during my fellowshipâ€”and now itâ€™s here for you.
